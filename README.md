# professional-readme-generator

The purpose of this project was to create a calendar application that allows its users to save events for each hour of the day. The hours of the day will update by the hour that has passed highlighting as grey, the current hour red, and the hour to come in green. The user can input their task for a specific hour for it to be saved until they delete it. 

-Jquery was used to manipulate the DOM and to create the variables needed to notate the date, hours and specific time of day. 

-A for loop was incorporated to cycle through the times of day and notate the current hour. 

-Moment.js was used to detect the exact time. 

-Local storage was used to ensure the user's input would be stored when the application is refreshed in the browser. 

 # Installation

To run this locally, fork the repo, clone it, and open the 'index.html' in your default browser.
